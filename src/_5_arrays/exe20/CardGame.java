/**
 * In a card game there are 4 players represented by 1, 2, 3 & 4.
 * In each turn the 3 players will be declared ï¿½ the winner, the second place and the third place.
 * The forth player will be considered as the looser of the turn.
 * 
 * The point each player gets:
 * - The winner gets 7 points.
 * - Second place gets 3 points
 * - Third place do not get any points
 * - Looser looses 4 points.
 * 
 * The winner of the game is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.
 * 
 * Write a Java program that reads the number of turns, then read for each turn the player numbers of the winner, second & third place.
 * 
 * The output is the number of the winner of the game.
 * 
 * Note: The total score can be negative.
