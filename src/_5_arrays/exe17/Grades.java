 * At a school, each class have 2 exams. The final grade is the highest score between the 2 exams.
 * 
 * Write a Java program the reads the number of students in a class then reads the grades of the first exam to an array �grade1�.
 * Then it reads the grades of the second exam to an array �grades2.
 * 
 * The program will fill another array �finalGrade� with the final grade for each student.
 * 
 * The output should be the 2 grades for each student and the final grade for each student.
