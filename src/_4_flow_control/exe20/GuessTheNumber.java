/**
 * Write a Java program for the game �Guess the number�:
 * The program select a random number between 1 and 100.
 * The user needs to guest that number.
 * There will be a loop that:
 * - Will ask the user to guess the number.
 * - If the guess is correct � it will print that the guess is correct and the number of guesses.
 * - If the guess is incorrect � it will print if the selected number is above or below the guess.
 * - The game can be stopped at any time by typing -99 or EOL (you can select).
 * 
 * How to generate a random number is a range:
 * 	Random rand = new Random();
 * 	randomNumber = rand.nextInt(max - min+1) + min;
